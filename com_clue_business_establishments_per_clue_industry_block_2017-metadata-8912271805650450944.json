The data shows the number of business establishments per city (CLUE) block, classified by their CLUE industry (from ANZSIC) and small area allocation. The data is aggregated to the 2016 Blocks for CLUE Boundaries and covers the year period of 2017.<br/><br/>\n\nA business establishment is defined as a \n<ul>\n<li>Commercial occupant in a building</li>\n<li>Separate land use</li>\n<li>Any permanent presence of economic activity in accordance with standard Industry classification (ANZSIC).</li>\n</ul><br/>\n\nHence, if one organisation has its presence in several buildings in the CLUE area, each time it will be counted as a separate establishment. Consequently, the count of establishments presented in CLUE represents the number of locations, rather than 'enterprises'.<br/><br/>\n\nFor more information please visit the <a href=\"https://www.melbourne.vic.gov.au/about-melbourne/research-and-statistics/city-economy/census-land-use-employment/Pages/clue.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">City of Melbourne CLUE Portal</a> and <a href=\"http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/mf/1292.0\" target=\"_blank\">ABS ANZSIC Page</a>.<br/><br/>\n\nPlease note: \n<ul>\n<li>AURIN has spatially enabled the data acquired through the <a href=\"https://data.melbourne.vic.gov.au/clue\" target=\"_blank\">City of Melbourne Open Data Portal</a>.</li>\n<li>The individual yearly tables have been extracted from the archived 2002-2017 tables.</li>\n<li>The data in this table is a snapshot and not live.</li>\n</ul>\n","selectedAttributes":[{"name":"block_id","type":"Integer","title":"Block Identifier","description":"Block identifier.
